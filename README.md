# FromBitsToSoftware

FromBitsToSoftware is my digital lab notebook — a chronicle of my evolution as a software developer and cybersecurity enthusiast.

It’s more than just documentation. It’s a deep dive into the essence of computing — from the raw ones and zeros that power machines, to the abstract beauty of programming languages, paradigms, and logic.

This repo follows my journey as I explore how simple bits become complex systems — code that thinks, creates, and secures.

## 🧩 The Journey

Every file, snippet, and note here represents a checkpoint — an experiment, a discovery, or a failed attempt that taught me something real about how computers think.

Starting with the basics of programming — logic, syntax, and structure.

Moving into language paradigms — understanding how different languages shape thought.

Exploring the weird world of esoteric languages, where code becomes art and philosophy.

Getting closer to the metal with assembly and machine code, where abstraction fades and hardware takes center stage.

Building and breaking things through projects, each one a step toward mastering the craft.

# Introduction to Programming

> Basics, syntax, logic, control flow, data types, problem solving.
Reflections on learning to think computationally




&nbsp;

# Programming Language Paradigms

> Procedural vs Object-Oriented vs Functional vs Logic programming.
How different paradigms shape how we think and write code.




&nbsp;

# Esoteric Languages (Esolangs)

> Exploring weird, creative, or absurd languages that challenge normal coding conventions.
Brainfuck, Befunge, Malbolge, and more.




&nbsp;

# Assembly Language

> Low-level exploration. Understanding registers, memory, instructions, and control flow.
Learning how high-level languages translate into machine operations.




&nbsp;

# Machine Code

> Binary, opcodes, instruction sets.
The language of hardware — where abstraction ends and raw logic begins.



&nbsp;

# Projects

> Hands-on builds, experiments, and mini tools created along the way.
Focused on learning, breaking, and optimizing code.

- Hello world programes

- Building a programming language

# Notes & Reflections

> Random thoughts, insights, debugging notes, and "aha!" moments from the journey.
