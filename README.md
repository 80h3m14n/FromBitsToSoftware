# FromBitsToSoftware

FromBitsToSoftware is my digital lab notebook — a chronicle of my evolution as a software developer and cybersecurity enthusiast.

It’s more than just documentation, it’s a deep dive into the essence of computing, from the raw ones and zeros that power machines, to the abstract beauty of programming languages, paradigms, and logic.

This repo follows my journey as I explore how simple bits become complex systems — code that thinks, creates, and secures.

## The Journey

Every file, snippet, and note here represents a checkpoint — an experiment, a discovery, or a failed attempt that taught me something real about how computers think.

Starting with the basics of programming — logic, syntax, and structure.

Moving into language paradigms — understanding how different languages shape thought.

Exploring the weird world of esoteric languages, where code becomes art and philosophy.

Getting closer to the metal with assembly and machine code, where abstraction fades and hardware takes center stage.

Building and breaking things through projects, each one a step toward mastering the craft.

# Introduction to Programming

This is the foundation of software development, where you learn to write instructions that computers can execute.

Reflections on learning to think computationally


### PL Syntax & logic
- Control flow
- Data types & variables
- Functions
- Arithmetic operations
- Libraries
- Problem solving.
